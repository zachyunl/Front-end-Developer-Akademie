      <p>
        Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered
        all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do.
        Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out
        there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record
        of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of
        Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that
        make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not
        into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks
        and iconic treks you’ll love, too.

          keep us smiling all day long. Here is just a sampling of what

            <p>She has booked two major European trips for us in the past year and every aspect
                has met, and in most cases exceeded, our expectations. Best prices, best hotels,
                best itineraries, and best cruises, she does it all. But the most important thing is she
                remembers the little things that we would do if we were making the plans ourselves.</p>

            <p>Leigh McAdam has been making my travel arrangements for about 20 years and
                there is no one else I would trust to arrange my trips and tours. I've also had great
                fun on a few of the group trips she has arranged - Peru & Machu Picchu and a
                10-day cruise out of Venice and diving. It's always an eclectic group of well traveled,
                interesting people.</p>
