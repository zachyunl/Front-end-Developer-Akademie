      <p>
        Opportunities for challenging hikes and pleasant strolls are scattered
        all over this planet; you just need to know where to find them. We do.
        Kilimanjaro, Everest Base Camp, Patagonia, and the Inca Trail are out
        there, waiting for you to walk all over them. We’re proud of our record
        of successful ascents (over 92% of our travellers make it to the top of
        Kili, depending on the route), but it’s our CEOs and local guides that
        make the journey itself as memorable as the summit. And if you’re not
        into big climbs, don’t sweat it; we’ve got loads of lower-impact walks
        and iconic treks you’ll love, too.
